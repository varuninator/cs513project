    "## Description of Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "With around 45,000 menus dating from the 1840s to today, The New York Public Library’s restaurant menu collection is one of the largest globally, attracting historians, chefs, novelists, and food enthusiasts. However, these menus are challenging to search for their most valuable details: specific information about dishes, prices, meal organization, and the historical and cultural stories they reveal. To address this, we will be cleaning this dataset to make it more useful. As a first step, below we have outline the tables of the data available that has been provided by NYPL."

An example would be finding menus that included the 5 most popular dishes for a given time period, with popularity defined by the number of menus the dish has appeared on. The Menu dataset has several columns with missing values (e.g., 'name', 'occasion', 'keywords'), and there are inconsistencies in the date format and categorical data (e.g., venue names).

For example, if people wanted to see a catalog of entries based on a search for personal observation. One can conduct basic descriptive statistics or other analysis directly on the provided data if they wanted to, for example counting menus by sponsor or year, but then the end result would be suspect. \n",

    "Data cleaning is not sufficient in use cases that involve analysis on fields that are missing too many values, or analysis that requires columns that are missing entirely. An example would be in the dish dataset, no amount of cleaning could fix the fact that the description field is entirely empty, and thus no analysis can be done on it at all."

    "## Data Quality Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The Menu dataset exhibits several data quality issues: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Missing values in critical columns such as 'name' (14,348 missing out of 17,545), 'occasion' (13,754 missing), and completely empty columns like 'keywords', 'language', and 'location_type'. For instance, row 0 has missing values in 'name', 'event', 'occasion', 'keywords', 'language', and 'currency'. The MenuPage dataset also has missing values in 'page_number' (1,202 missing out of 66,937), 'full_height', and 'full_width' (329 missing each), with row 1200 missing 'page_number'. In MenuItems, price (445,916 missing out of 1,332,726) and dish_id (241 missing out of 1,332,726) has missing values. In the dish dataset, all elementsfor description are missing.\n",
    " 2. The 'date' column in the Menu Tablehas inconsistent formats that need standardization to datetime, e.g., '1900-04-15'. \n",
    " 3. Redundant columns like 'keywords' and 'language' in the Menu Table add no value due to being entirely empty. \n",
    " 4. The dataset also likely contains duplicate entries, which could distort analysis results, exemplified by potential duplicates in 'id', 'name', and 'sponsor' in the Menu Table. \n",
    " 5. Inconsistent categorical data in the Menu Table, such as varying cases in 'venue' (e.g., 'COMMERCIAL' vs 'COMMERCIAL;'), further complicate analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is crucial for supporting the main use case U1 to ensure the dataset's completeness and reliability. Handling missing values, particularly in 'name' and 'occasion', ensures that the dataset is robust for analysis. For example, dropping rows with missing 'name' values ensures every menu entry is identifiable. Ensuring different variants of the same name are merged would increase accuracy in any aggregations across that field Standardizing data formats, like converting 'date' to datetime, facilitates accurate chronological analysis. Removing redundant columns, such as 'keywords' and 'language', simplifies the dataset and focuses on valuable data. Identifying and removing duplicates prevents distorted analysis results, ensuring each entry is unique. Ensuring consistency in categorical data, such as standardizing venue names to uppercase, ensures accurate grouping and analysis. These steps make the dataset accurate and reliable, supporting effective analysis for the main use case U1. Ensuring integrity constraints allows for more accurate querying and prevents confusion when looking at menu and dish data."

    "## Initial Plan Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tWeeks 8 through 11 - Reviewing The Dataset and Use Case: Our dataset includes 4 tables: Menu, Menupage, MenuItem, and dish. The Menu table includes information about physical menus, including historical information, uses, and formats. MenuPages capture the pages of menus, and are modeled after stored digital images of the menus. The MenuItem table tracks the occurrences of a single dish appearing somewhere on a menu page, and the Dish table includes information about all the dishes from all the menus. Our use case is aggregation and filtering across relationships. An example is finding menus that included the 5 most popular dishes for a given time period, with popularity defined by the number of menus the dish has appeared on. All team members will contribute to the review of the dataset and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWeek 8 - Profiling the Dataset: We will use python and OpenRefine to identify cardinalities, data types, value distributions, correlations, constraints, duplicates and syntactic errors. We will use Datalog to help identify violations of integrity constraints, and logical semantic and structural errors. Once we have identified all types of errors, we will create a checklist to go through, and create a list of examples that we can track the improvement in. Jason, Rohan will profile the dataset via OpenRefine. ____ will check for integrity constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWeek 9 through 11 - Performing the data cleaning process: We will be primarily using OpenRefine and Python to implement the data cleaning as it relates to syntactic errors. OpenRefine’s GUI and existing functionality lends itself to solving a lot of syntactic errors, while using the Pandas library in Pytho will provide any addintional flexibility for manipulating data that may be more difficult to do in OpenRefine. As for errors relating to integrity restraints and semantics, Datalog will be especially useful for that. Varun will handle syntactic errors and duplicates via OpenRefine. ____ will enforce and clean data as it relates to integrity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWeeks 9 through 11 - Checking: We will maintain a list of examples and systematically verify that they are indeed becoming cleaner after each transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tWeeks 9 through 11 - Documentation of Change: we will use python to create scripts to quantitatively analyze the improvement in data cleanliness, while also creating visual representations to track improvements along the way.\n"
